# WORK  
**Toxicologist and Intellectual Property Consultant**  
(2001-current) Consultant toxicologist and scientist assisting with general toxicology and intellectual property issues. Involvement with protocols, proposals, life cycle analysis, structure activity relationships across environmental, biotechnology, pharmaceutical sectors. Contributor to research plans, proposals, and research leading to the development U.S. patent applications related to therapeutic polynucleic acids (filings 2002-current). Negotiated non-disclosure agreements and strategies related to the design and screening of new molecular entities. Early stage development efforts were undertaken for an innovative class of therapeutic (e.g., U.S. Patent Application 20060166916  and related documents/divisional application(s), now patent 7,482,158, January 27, 2009. During this time also worked as Controller (Unit Clerk (with flexible schedule)) from Sep-2007 to Jun-2019 (and Per Diem > 01-Jul-2014). Sodexo, Westmont College - assisting General Manager with Unit Financial System involving all aspects of resource management, accounts payable, cashier/cash handling procedures, billing and information technology (IT). Interactions periodically with Westmont College staff in position with flexible hours that enabled consulting and contractual work (with full time parenting). Additional pro-bono / non-compensated work coaching youth sports. Note: XpRx Pharmaceuticals LLC was briefly formed and ultimately dissolved during this time holding some intellectual property while also providing limited liability coverage.

**Senior Scientist / Toxicologist**  
(01-Aug-1999 to 01-Jan-2001*) ISIS (now IONIS) Pharmaceuticals, 2292 Faraday Avenue, Carlsbad, CA 92008
Scientist, Study Director, and monitor with responsibilities for non-GLP and GLP toxicology studies supporting product development. Study design, contract monitoring, report generation and review of non-clinical studies and integrated toxicology/pharmacology sections of investigational new drug applications. _Position was full time prior to Nov 2001 and reduced to half-time after clinical trial failure of product ISIS 2302._  

**Research Toxicologist (Study Director)**     
(Feb-1993 through Dec-1998) E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, Haskell Laboratory for Toxicology and Industrial Medicine, P.O. Box 50, Elkton Road, Newark, DE 19714-0050. 
Duties: Study director and consulting toxicologist with responsibilities for non-GLP and GLP toxicology studies used to support product development, registration and re-registration. Areas of scientific accountability included bacterial mutagenesis, mammalian mutagenesis, and assays related to the assessment of DNA damage. Coordinator of chemical discovery program for genetic toxicology endpoints with skills structure activity relationships and computational methods/models as applied to general toxicology. Generation of protocols, standard operating procedures (procedural, equipment, and testing), reports, and validation plans for new equipment and testing strategies. Supervised technicians and involved in the evaluation, implementation and validation of software used for data collection and report generation. Involvement in automation efforts designed to improve testing and screening capacity, cost effectiveness and quality. As a DuPont Post-Doctoral Fellow: Duties involved upper respiratory tract carcinogenesis research that involved the generation of data for use in physiologically-based mechanistic models predictive of upper airway toxicity. Research also involved measurements of gas/vapor uptake, respiratory parameters associated with sensory irritation, and characterization of time/concentration related regional differences in DNA damage following inhalation exposure to dimethyl sulfate. Measurement of the formation and persistence (toxicokinetics) of DNA damage (DNA adducts) with comparison to additional expsoure related responses in the nasal passageway with the intent of better characterizing human helath risks. Research involve construction and maintenance of inhalation exposure systems, integration with infrared gas analyzers, and use of Hewlett Packard HPLCs and GCs.  

**Ph.D. Candidate / Research Assistant**  
(Sep-1987 through Nov-1992) California College of Medicine, Department of Community and Environmental Medicine - Graduate Program in Environmental Toxicology, University of California at Irvine, Irvine, CA 92714. Graduate work in molecular basis of carcinogenesis utilizing cell culture and molecular biology techniques. Investigated nucleic acid damage induced in rodent tissues following administration of hydrazine-based pharmaceuticals. Research established protocol(s) for the analysis of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) in DNA and studied effects of 5mC on the sequence specific alkylation of guanine. Initiated work using EBV infected human lymphoblasts to model carcinogen induced hypomethylation using methylation sensitive restriction endonucleases to assess reactivation of an inactivated HPRT gene. The UCI toxicology program required demonstration of computer literacy, statistical analyses as applied toward general toxicology, and graduate level student teaching. Additional pharmacology/immunology course work completed a minor emphasis of study.  

**Forensic Toxicologist / Criminalist**    
(1987) Orange County Sheriff-Coroner, 550 N. Flower St. Santa Ana, CA 92703 
Duties: Basic criminalist/toxicologist responsibilities included urine and blood alcohol concentration analysis by head-space gas chromatography. Analysis of opiate, barbiturate, and cocaine in human blood and urine samples by GC/MS after positive indication(s) of drugs by immunoassay. Duties also involved courtroom testimony as an expert witness.  

**Computer Operator/Data Entry Operator (positions prior to 1987)**  
Moulton Data Systems Inc. / Key West Systems / Data Gap Inc. (Northridge / Reseda / Reseda, CA).
Data entry & verification and some supervisory work. Positions primary used to support additional undergraduate college education. Typing and data entry using reverse 10-key systems. Hourly working wages $12-20/hr.
